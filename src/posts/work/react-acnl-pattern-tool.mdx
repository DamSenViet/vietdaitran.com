Animal Crossing New Leaf (ACNL) on 3DS had a feature where we could design
patterns and apply them to in-apparel and decor. Players could take these
patterns and generate QR codes to share or scan other player's codes to import
them into their game.

This is an application I wrote to to explore that ACNL pattern format, learn
how the QR encoding worked as well as evaluate and improve drawing performance.
One of the issues I found with the original was that, when drawing with large,
fast strokes, we'll end up missing pixels along the way. This is due to the
browser throttling event dispatching under heavier load. This was a problem I
desperately wanted to understand and solve.

## Approach

I rebuilt the core ACNL pattern format library to help me understand the binary
layout the pattern format of the as well as any other encoding of the data.

Anything that could be cached and slimmed in case of the drawing functions
I pre-emptively cached. The importance of caching could not be overstated in
trying to co-erce the browser to fire more events. I also cached the bounding client
rect calculation to avoid layout thrashing, reduced unecessary event handling,
and hardcoded lookups to reduce any unecessary CPU load.

Wanting to experiment with different optimization techniques, I also implemented
buffers for recording pixel changes in the pattern, debouncing the actual write
process to the pattern itself.

## Findings

Using the JavaScript profiler, I discovered that this experimental build won
out in some aspects but also lost out on others.

React's synthetic event handling has a considerable overhead. For applications
that require rapid event firing with low-overhead handling, there's a need to be
utilizing native event bindings provided by the browser combined with a
performant event handler. This will result in the browser firing as many
events as possible on an event like mouse dragging as to not miss any potential
events.

Because the browser will always throttle events to some degree due to currently
running JavaScript, rather than approach the problem of event dispatch
throttling as a performance issue, there should be recouncilation of
the throttling instead. Automatically calculating the pixels in between the
beginning and end of the stroke was an idea that I came to when building the
application since there will always be missed pixels depending on the size of
and speed of the drawing stroke.

The QR code library the original application used as well as the one I used,
did not supoprt multi-QR encoding which was required for it to work with
Animal Crossing New Leaf on the 3DS.

I was able to use these findings later when my team and I  worked on the [Animal
Crossing Pattern Tool](/work/acpatterns), giving these recommendations to my
team to help drive our design choices.
