## Background

In 2012, Nintendo released Animal Crossing New Leaf (ACNL) for their latest
portable console - the 3DS. This was the first of the Animal Crossing series
games to feature QR codes with a means of sharing in-game apparal designs
over the internet by uploading in-game screenshots of the QR code. While
ACNL continued to gain steam in popularity, so did the number of pattern
designers and QR codes. Spanning dedicated ACNL forums, Tumblr blogs posts,
Tweets, and Google Images, the method of discovering and sharing pattern
designs was decentralized and painful. Another problem noticed retrospectively
was plagiarism, a common complaint from the Japanese ACNL community. Designers
had been taking patterns from the Japanese community passing them off as their
own.

The first of people to begin solving these problems was Thulinma, a developer
from the Netherlands, who created an [early version of the pattern editor](https://thulinma.com/acnl/).
At the time it only handled ACNL patterns and couldn't show a 3D model preview
of the apparel that the pattern would be projected to in game. I reached out to
him about his application in 2018 trying to understand the underlying pattern
format encoded by the QR to prepare for the next anticipated Animal Crossing
game (and the next QR code format). With the pieces assembled I eventually began
making design mockups and [experimental performance tests](https://github.com/DamSenViet/react-acnl-pattern-tool)
for a centralized, searchable database of patterns.

Thulinma later extended an invitation to me to join him and Myumi, a developer
from New York, in making the next generation of the application, We made
uncommitted plans to develop a new application from scratch and decided to stay
in touch with each other. A majority of this time was spent idle, waiting
for Nintendo make some mention of patterns in their announcements or gameplay
previews. We continued waiting until March 2020 when Nintendo showcased patterns
in their [Nintendo Direct](https://youtu.be/Ie4WZCLbtVs?si=vDQJ7OIZFtq2WAl1) for
Animal Crossing New Horizons (ACNH), setting the release date a week or two
right after.

## Approaching Launch

With only 1-2 weeks of available development time, we hurriedly began
brainstorming ideas. Very quickly, we set up a Discord server to help us, who
were all residing in different timezones and regions, to communicate and support
our future users. We decided to deploy a web application on our own servers and
domains with the potential to release an offline version. The app would include
the pattern editor which would allow you to edit via a GUI, include the ability
to import and export QR codes and include backwards compatibility for ACNL
patterns. We also floated the idea of including the ability to convert regular
images to ACNL patterns as a bonus feature if we had time.

During initial development, the ACNH pattern format was not publicly
available. Our lead engineer would take of the pattern format libraries, backend api,
and infrastructure. We instead redirected a majority of our efforts to the frontend UI
and making the previous generation pattern format (ACNL) easier to work
with. Since no one had access to ACNH and so no one could data mine the
files just yet, we made plans to reverse-engineer and add this in a future
update (which we did).

We also wanted to include an account system, but with two weeks left, there
wasn't enough time & resources to securely and properly add authentication and
authorization. The benefits of an account system wouldn't solve plagiarism and
would also require us to setup more internal human infrastructure. Based on our
timeline, an account system was out of question.

### As Lead Frontend Engineer

As an experienced front-end developer on the team, I advised my team on our
potential technology stack, helping us decide on a build strategy to provide
both online and offline versions of the application. A combination of prior
[performance tests](https://github.com/DamSenViet/react-acnl-pattern-tool)
alongside wanting making sure to include everyone in the development process
eventually led us to settle on Vue.js – a component framework similar to
utilizing plain HTML, CSS, JS - easy to use for developers on the team
unfamilar with working in a component system and ES modules.

Becoming responsible for all of our setup including a custom development
environment, bundling, compression, and dependency structures was the easy part.
One of the unique problems that we ran into included needing to link a fork of
the QR Code library we needed to extend from the source code directly because it
didn't support encoding binary data and was written in TypeScript a different
language from the what were using which was JavaScript. This was handled with
git submodules at my suggestion so we could modify the original source and
reference it from our main project.

I spearheaded a large amount of our UI programming involved setting up our initial
routing, pages, portal managers, data stores, client-side caching systems, api
libraries, and integrating internationalization features.

### As Lead UI/UX Designer

With a prior background in UI/UX, I led the design efforts including making HD
mockups of our UI/UX, determining general art direction, design language, and
color schemes. Paired with my background in development, I also advised other
team members on the viability of specific UI features.

Before the project kicked off, I had already been working on the UI/UX design
for the application for quite a while. I did have a design in mind modeled
after fashion websites. We however rejected many of my initial designs as a team
because we wanted the UI to feel playful and match the upcoming game's design
language and make it feel less business-oriented. Looking back, I'm incredibly
glad we did.

## Post Launch Challenges

### Time Allocation

Over the course of the project, I realized we had split too much of my time
between my two roles as developer and designer, that I had trouble fixing
bottlenecks. Even after the initial release, I found myself having to
spend too much time on the UI/UX designs to help move development forward.

After our initial release, we encountered many offers of other community
members volunteering to help. We eventually vetted and brought on Tero, a
icon/brand designer from Germany, onto the team, we were able to free up
more of my time for development.

### Attacked and Scaled

Within the first week of releasing our application in late March, we had
received a DDOS attack from a disgruntled Discord member we had banned for
harassing other community members. Our server was down for approximately half
a day while we scrambled to set up a reverse proxy to deal with the high load
of requests and deal with malicious ones.

### User-Generated Content

I learned that when you have user-generated content, but don't have the human
resources to moderate that content, you end up with some very glaring issues.
During the week of release, we received complaints about inappropriate content
in our pattern database. This content included racism, sexism, genderism, porn,
gore, etc – clearly not content meant for kids or those playing Animal Crossing
for relaxation purposes, which would be a large portion of our users. We were
even featured on [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-21-animal-crossing-new-horizons-players-are-putting-memes-hand-wash-warnings-and-some-very-nasty-things-in-their-islands)
for this blunder.

### Nintendo's Legal Team

I remember I woke up on a weekend during spring break getting a phone call
from Thulinma, "Did you not see what happened? Check your discord." Nintendo
had sent us a legal notice, pleasantly worded, that we take down the website
entirely, citing us for copyright infringement (for allowing users to convert
**their** images into QR Codes for **their** game and for inappropriate
content) despite the fact that the feature to scan QR codes at all, was Nintendo's
decision. I did heavily agree that we needed a way to moderate the patterns,
but not with the copyright infringement. Even if our application did not exist,
users could still create copyright infringing content in-game without our help.

In the same exact day we got the notice, we temporarily disabled the browsing
system, setup NSFW filters, and began work on a moderating system. We also
removed all references to Nintendo at their request. At this point, Nintendo
de-escalated the legal threat and left us somewhat confused about their intentions,
despite us not taking away the ability to convert images to patterns and then to
QR Codes.

Nintendo later showed up again in a news article when asked by the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendos-animal-crossing-goes-upscale-with-museum-masterpieces-11597852490)
about their thoughts on our application. Their response:

> “very happy” that the game is able to “facilitate the creative and social activities of people around the world.”

## Successes

### Large Consistent Userbase

You might recall that we actually left the backend to our lead engineer to
handle. This was the correct call. With my financial resources I could not
afford the infrastructure required to even remotely support our large userbase.

Here are our stats of unique users for the first month of release (April):

![April traffic stats](/work/acpatterns/stats-1.png)

By May our numbers began to sink a bit, but it was expected because the
popularity and visibility of the game began to fizzle. Users began to
understand that the new game was no longer centered around interaction, but
around customization. Many of them (including myself) were feeling burnout
from the game which did occur in previous games in the series. Nintendo's new
update model also excluded meaningful additions to the base game, only adding
event-exclusive in-game items.

![May traffic stats](/work/acpatterns/stats-2.png)

Regardless, over the months, we have still have millions of unique monthly
global users.

### Social Media

We've made it into popular culture! Over the first few COVID months, you
could see us all over social media channels. Our patterns and QR codes were
included in the posts of popular Facebook groups such as "Subtle Asian
Traits", on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_R-61pFrjP/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet),
and even on Twitter by pixel art arists. Even popular Youtube gaming channel
[GameXplain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qrvb0Pi29c) made a video about
our application and a tutorial of how to use it!

We gained enough traction to even be featured in news articles of
well-established digital news outlets such as [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendos-animal-crossing-goes-upscale-with-museum-masterpieces-11597852490),
[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/27/21197396/turn-pictures-into-murals-patterns-in-game-nook-link-qr-code).

Museums like the [Getty](https://experiments.getty.edu/ac-art-generator) built
on our codebase an opportunity to engage new audiences by making their own art
collections available as QR codes. This motivated me to make a [separate publicly available library](./acpatterns-js)
for developers who want to automate the process or make similar applications.

Other companies were also using our platform as a way to advertise and engage
with their customers. This [tweet by KFC Phillipines](https://twitter.com/KFCPhilippines/status/1273093956763439104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1273093956763439104%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Feconsultancy.com%2Fthe-animal-crossing-phenomenon-marketing%2F)
includes patterns that were converted using our tool demonstrating how wide-reaching
our platform had become over social media. A similar marketing strategy was also used
by [President Joe Biden.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21409727/biden-harris-animal-crossing-campaign-new-horizons-yard-signs-election)

## Final Thoughts

Developing, designing, and maintaining the application has helped me
familiarize myself with the challenges in a product's lifecycle as well as
helped me understand the concept of product ownership. It meant providing
support to users (both non-developers and developers), responding to feature
requests, reviewing code, managing contributions, and coordinating with team
members. I'm glad that we were able to deploy a tool for others to meaningfully
engage over social media and games, glad that we were recogized for it, and
proud that our work had a positive impact on players.

This was a great experience and I hope to continue making applications for other communities.
