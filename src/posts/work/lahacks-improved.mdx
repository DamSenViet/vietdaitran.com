## Background

This was an improved version of an application I built at a hackathon in Los
Angeles. The original was quite a bland application at the time, one you could
probably find a tutorial to do. I didn't feel quite satisifed with what had I
made so I took another chance at it.

What I was really after was to redesign this with a sleeker UI and real mobile
apps with hero animations (going from card to spanning the entire screen).

## Retrospective

I took this opportunity to learn a bunch of CSS tricks and optimizations. These
included learning more about the browser's rendering pipeline and how to
separate elements onto separate animatable layers via transform translate
properties. While implementing these I also came across the practice of
requesting animation frames before triggering any animations via JavaScript.
I also learned that the browser also placed limits to how much animation
optimization could be applied.


Among the CSS tricks I experimented with included sprite sheet animations.
This wasn't something I was even aware was possible in CSS at the time. After
coming across  some articles about how Twitter implemented their sprite sheet
animation really made me want to give it a shot. I ended up using this for the
favorite / like button!

Building this new version of the application, I was able to work more with
responsive design and CSS media queries - a topic I had been seeking more
practice on at the time in my quest of learning to build commercial-grade
applications.

This also forced me to work more with databases - designing database tables for
a potential social media site, learning more about issuing queries and
sanitizing user input outside of my academics.
