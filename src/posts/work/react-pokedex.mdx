This was an application I made as part of a screening for the software
engineering intern at Immerse, a VR language education platform. The goal of the
application was to demonstrate requisite knowledge about interacting with an
API, and to be able to talk about design decisions.

## Approach

Originally I wanted to make a Pokédex, an in-game enclopedia from Nintendo's IP,
Pokémon, after seeing [BryanC's design concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/2901787-Pokemon-OG)
of a modern UI for a Pokédex. The detailed information page was out of scope
for this application so I decided to forego it to focus on API interaction.

This was to be done in React as an SPA per technical challenge requirements.

Based off the design, I needed the sprite for each Pokemon, a component to hold
the species name and evolution-stage type, a component to hold the numerous type
filters, a component to hold the region / generation filters, and a component
to hold the search input. The filters were designed as controlled or puppeteered
components while the search and results could just pull their state from The
root component.

I didn't have much experience with http request utility libraries designed to
simplify creation of the `XMLHTTPRequest` object beyond `jQuery` at the time and
I wanted to try something new so I ended up picking `request`. I organized the
HTTP request helper methods around actions that the application would be
responsible for fetching and processing rather than making calls directly from
the components.


## Feedback

After getting feedback from the software engineer responsible for the
interview process, I was feeling pretty good. One of the things I was able to do
well was structure the API. I was suggested to pick up the [Axios HTTP request
library](https://github.com/axios/axios) since it structures it's API request
object and creation quite similarly to the way that I had structured mine
without it.

I was also recommended to avoid needing binding when passing event handlers
down the compnent tree with arrow functions instead. These were practices I
readily adopted not having known that these were available options to me at the
time - JS was something I was just learning at the time outside of my academic
work (which was mostly Python and C++).


## Improvements

After the screening for my application and getting the internship, I actually
realized I hadn't optimized filtering performance when searching for Pokémon and
this was something that bother me quite a bit during development. I ended up
returning to this implementation to improve with regex match instead of looping
through when looking for regional variants and mega evolutions which were
treated as special stages of evolution, I applied a regex to a stringified
version of the response to drastically improve performance when using this
information to issue subsequent issues to the PokéAPI. This helped reduce the
rate at which we would approach the rate limit.


## Retrospective Reflection

Looking back, for the time period, I definitely felt like the screening
challenge to was intended to force me to utilize some form of an
application state library like Redux or utilize the one built-into React at the
time which was React context.

Without one, handling the asynchronous nature of request callbacks did prove
to be a bit more difficult. The internship itself actually taught me a lot
about how to utilize and structure application state so I'm really glad I had
the experience of getting the internship.
